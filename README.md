# Detecting-COVID-19-with-Chest-X-Ray-using-PyTorch

Chest X-Ray  scans which are categorized in three classes - Normal, Viral Pneumonia and COVID-19.👩‍⚕️ 

In this project we have create an image classification model that can predict Chest X-Ray scans that belong to one of the three classes with a reasonably high accuracy.
(The accuracy recieved in this project is about 95% on test data)👯‍♀️

In this project we have used:
 - Create custom Dataset and DataLoader in `PyTorch` 🔦
 - Train a `ResNet-18` model in PyTorch to perform Image Classification

This cannot be used to detect in real world🌏 because the data might not be suffificent (the dataset is taken from kaggle having around 3000 images).
